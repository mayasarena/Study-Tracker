# Study-Tracker
This iOS application was developed for my Master's Thesis. It's compatible with iOS 15.0+. It is a simple study tracking app that features a timer, 
a history page where users can edit and delete previous sessions, tags to organize sessions, charts that provide feedback to the user about their study sessions, 
and some settings. Read below to see a detailed outline with videos of the features.

## Stopwatch Page
The stopwatch page features Start and Stop buttons that the user can click to begin and end their study sessions. There's a button at the top to select a tag for the session. <br>

## Charts Page
This page is the most important as it provides feedback to the user. Users can use the calendar to hop between dates, or they can use the back and forward buttons.
Users can switch between daily, weekly, or monthly data. <br>
